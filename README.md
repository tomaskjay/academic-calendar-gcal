# Case Academic Calendar GCal Generator

## What it's for
Case only provides a GCal for courses, so students have to look up important dates by searching for the school's academic calendar page. This makes things a bit easier by
scraping https://case.edu/registrar/dates-deadlines/academic-calendar based on an input of an academic session and creates a url that can be used to import a all of the dates/deadlines from the page.
